## Description

A simple plugin that integrates [Polylang](https://polylang.pro/) multilanguage plugin with layout, headers and footers contents created with Cornerstone builder in Pro themes by [Theme.co](https://theme.co/pro)

## Installation 

For detailed installation instructions, please read the [standard installation procedure for WordPress plugins](https://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Installing_Plugins).

1. Make sure [Polylang](https://polylang.pro/) and [Pro Theme](https://theme.co/pro) are installed and running.
2. Install and activate plugin.

## How to use

Assign each active language with Pro elements you have made in settings. You can find this plugin's settings in Wordpress admin menu *Languages* -> *Pro Theme Support*.

You can assign each CS element to one or multiple active languages. Just click on the flag to select or deselect the assignment. The native CS assignment will be applied alongside the language assignment of this plugin, so if you have multiple elements of the same type assigned to the same language, the assignment conditions and priorities you have defined in CS will be applied.
